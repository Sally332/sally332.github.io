**Computational Biologist | Cancer Genomics & Interpretable AI**

I develop **interpretable machine learning frameworks** that integrate multi-omic and spatial data to uncover the molecular logic of cancer. My work combines **mechanistic interpretability, reproducibility, and biological grounding**, aiming to build research-ready frameworks rather than one-off analyses. Current focus areas include **spatial transcriptomics**, **drug-response modeling**, and **graph-based multimodal architectures**.

## Research Focus

My research sits at the intersection of **single-cell genomics**, **systems biology**, and **machine learning**. I design biologically constrained models that embed prior knowledge directly into their architecture, enabling transparent interpretation of high-dimensional genomic data. A central theme across my work is the development of **concept-bottleneck and pathway-aware models** that support mechanistic insight, reproducibility, and robust benchmarking across datasets, tissues, and modalities.

Key areas of interest include:
- Single-cell and spatial transcriptomics  
- Multimodal data integration (scRNA-seq, scATAC-seq, spatial data)  
- Interpretable deep learning and graph-based models  
- Perturbation and drug-response modeling  
- Reproducible computational genomics workflows

## Research Vision

**Interpretable by design · Reproducible by construction · Generalizable across data modalities.**

My long-term goal is to establish **transparent and reusable computational standards** for cancer genomics frameworks that predict, explain, and generalize across tissues, datasets, and modalities.
